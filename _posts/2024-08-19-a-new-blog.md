Hello everyone,  

I’m excited to announce my return after a long break. I [previously](https://binary4fun.wordpress.com/) had a blog in Hebrew, and now I’m starting fresh with a new blog in English. In this blog, I’ll mainly focus on Windows Internals, Intel VT-x, Hyper-V, Secure Kernel, and reverse engineering. Stay tuned for upcoming posts!
